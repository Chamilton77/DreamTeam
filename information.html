		<p id="par1" class="paragraphs">All over the world people are using the Oceans as a dump. Poluting our oceans like this is puting a strain on all of the ocean life. From chocking on plastic bags to getting caught in soda holders what we put in the ocean is taking a toll. Animal life is effected by every kind of pollution. Plastics catch animals and suffocate them while chemical polutants make animals sick and cause birth defects.</p>

		<h1 class="title1">Here's what were doing to change this!</h1>
		<p id="par2" class="paragraphs">In the last few years we have made good strides towards cleaning up the oceans and making it a better place for the animals that call it home. Our foundation has been going all over the globe cleaning up beaches and doing our best to find any animals that are in need of help. One specific story that we find very important was helping a sea turtle that had rope wrapped around its neck so tightly that it was having trouble breathing and eating. We took the turle into the boat and cut off the rope. You could tell that right as the rope came off the turtle felt relived and started to move around a lot more. We put the turtle back in the water and it swam off right away. This is just one of the things made possible by your donations please keep helping us clean up the ocean one piece at at time!</p>
